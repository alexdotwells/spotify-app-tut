# Spotify App Tutorial #

Hi! My name is Alex. I've created this tutorial to show you how to build and application that utilizes the Spotify Web API using Node.js. We'll break down the authorization-flow options they have available, and then build an application from scratch that with securely authorize & authenticate our user with the Spotify accounts service, and return a token we can use to access private Spotify endpoints.

I selected Node.js backend because I believe JavaScript & JSON are easy to work with for most people, and may be used on both the server and client side.
