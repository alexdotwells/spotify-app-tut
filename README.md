# Spotify from Scratch #
#### *Spotify Authorization Flow Tutorial* ####
___

Hi! My name is Alex :)

I recently helped a friend understand the [Spotify Authorization & Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/) as a result of hearing there were insufficient learning resources available online.

As a result I've created this step-by-step tutorial to break down the authorization-flow options Spotify has available, and build an application from scratch that will securely authorize & authenticate a user with the Spotify accounts service, and return a token for accessing private endpoints.

I selected Node.js backend based on a belief that JavaScript & JSON are easy to work with for most people, and can be used on both the server and client sides.
